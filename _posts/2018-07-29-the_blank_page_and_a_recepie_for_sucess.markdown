I have been working on my CLI App project. In selecting a topic, I faced the sort of decision I often wrestle with in sarting a new project; be it baking, the home improvement projects that always crop up (despite me not owning a home), or coding: I know that I tend to gravitate towards the overambitious while I am still learning the tools and methods. This is a good way to stretch and learn, but it's not without growing pains.

As it is for writers of prose, as a writer of code, I find that starting at a blank screen, not knowing where to start is a bit paralysing. As with projects in the physical world, I have found it helpful to take a step back, open a new file in my IDE, and brainstorm. Once I've let ideas swirl around, I am able to create an outline that acts as the scaffold for my project. 

Taking the time to think about the steps and connections needed to make the disparate parts work together, how I want my command line interface to look, and if and how I can simplify my work before I start in ernest helps me organize my thinking so that I am able to follow the outline of my overall plan as I build the project.

With my outline in hand, the blank page is an opportunity, not an opposing force, and I am able to use my growing skillset to bring what I have planed to fruition. I chose to do my CLI App project on scraping and aggrigating recepies from several of my favorite webpages so that I can look through recepies from multiple sites simultaneously. I am still working out the kinks in my program, but so far, the results are apetizing.
