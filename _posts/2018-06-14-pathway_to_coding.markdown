Love to learn and to solve problems, and with coding, you are never done learning and there are always new problems to solve, be it learning new languages, coming up with better ways to set up systems, or honing down to more parsimonious methods.

I believe tech should be for everyone- both from the perspective of who is in our field, and who tech serves and how. For me a big piece of this is digital accessibility; how UI, code and the way websites, hardware and social media platforms serve people of all abilities. Finding new and better ways to communicate through tech can help dissolve boundaries that unnecessarily exist in our world.

Coding is fundamentally a creative process; there are multiple right solutions to solving a problem and the way different folks approach it tells you about how their mind works. I have been able to feel my own approaches shifting as I learn more, and I look forward to continuing to develop myself in this respect.
